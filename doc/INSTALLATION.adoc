## Installation

Execute:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/zplugin/master/doc/install.sh)"
```

To update run the command again (or just execute `doc/install.sh`) or run `zplugin self-update`.

`Zplugin` will be installed into `~/.zplugin/bin`. `.zshrc` will be updated with
three lines of code that will be added to the bottom (the lines will be sourcing
`zplugin.zsh` and setting up completion).

Completion will be available, for command **zplugin** and aliases **zpl**, **zplg**.

After installing and reloading shell give `Zplugin` a quick try with `zplugin help`
and compile it with `zplugin self-update`.

### Manual Installation

To manually install `Zplugin` clone the repo to e.g. `~/.zplugin/bin`:

```sh
mkdir ~/.zplugin
git clone https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin.git ~/.zplugin/bin
```

and source it from `.zshrc` (**above compinit**):

```sh
source ~/.zplugin/bin/zplugin.zsh
```

If you place the `source` below `compinit`, then add those two lines after the `source`:
```sh
autoload -Uz _zplugin
(( ${+_comps} )) && _comps[zplugin]=_zplugin
```

Various paths can be customized, see the README's section link:../README.md#customizing-paths\--other[Customizing Paths].

After installing and reloading shell give `Zplugin` a quick try with `zplugin help` and
compile it with `zplugin self-update`.

## Compilation
It's good to compile `zplugin` into `Zsh` bytecode:

```sh
zcompile ~/.zplugin/bin/zplugin.zsh
```

**NEW:** `zplugin self-update` now also performs full zplugin compilation on each run.

Zplugin will compile each newly downloaded plugin. You can clear compilation of
a plugin by invoking `zplugin uncompile {plugin-spec}`. There are also commands
`compile`, `compiled` that control the functionality of compiling plugins.
