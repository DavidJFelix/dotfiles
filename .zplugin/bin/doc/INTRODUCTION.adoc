## Introduction

**Example use:**

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin load zdharma/history-search-multi-word
% zplugin light zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Above commands show two ways of basic plugin loading. **load** causes reporting
to be enabled – you can track what plugin does, view the information with
`zplugin report {plugin-spec}`. **light** is a significantly faster loading
without tracking and reporting (note: plugin-unloading needs the tracking; also
note: **in turbo mode the slowdown caused by tracking is neglectable).**

### Oh-My-Zsh, Prezto

To load Oh-My-Zsh and Prezto plugins, use `snippet` feature. Snippets are single
files downloaded by `curl`, `wget`, etc. directly from URL. For example:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin snippet 'https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh'
% zplugin snippet 'https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/master/modules/helper/init.zsh'
```

Also, you can use `OMZ::` and `PZT::` shorthands:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin snippet OMZ::plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh
% zplugin snippet PZT::modules/helper/init.zsh
```

Moreover, snippets support `Subversion` protocol, supported also by Github.
This allows to load snippets that are multi-file (for example a Prezto module
can have file `init.zsh` and file `alias.zsh`). Default files that will be
sourced are: `*.plugin.zsh`, `init.zsh`, `*.zsh-theme`:

```SystemVerilog
# URL points to directory
% zplugin ice svn; zplugin snippet PZT::modules/docker
```

### Snippets and performance

Using `curl`, `wget`, etc., `Subversion` allows to almost completely avoid code
dedicated to Oh-My-Zsh and Prezto, and also to other frameworks. This gives
profits in performance of `Zplugin`, it is really fast and also compact (low
memory usage, short loading time).

### Some Ice-modifiers

The command `zplugin ice` provides Ice-modifiers for single next command (see
the README subsection
link:https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin#ice-modifiers[ice-modifiers]). The logic
is that "ice" is something that melts (so it doesn't last long) and something
that's added. Using other Ice-modifier "**pick**" user can explicitly select the
file to source:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin ice svn pick"init.zsh"; zplugin snippet PZT::modules/git
```

Content of Ice-modifier is simply put into `"..."`, `'...'`, or `$'...'`. No
need for `":"` after Ice-mod name. This way editors like `vim` and `emacs` will
highlight contents of Ice-modifiers.

### as"program"

A plugin might not be a file for sourcing, but a command to be added to `$PATH`.
To obtain this effect, use Ice-modifier `as` with value `program`.

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin ice as"program" cp"httpstat.sh -> httpstat" pick"httpstat"
% zplugin light b4b4r07/httpstat
```

Above command will add plugin directory to `$PATH`, copy file `httpstat.sh` into
`httpstat` and add execution rights (`+x`) to the file selected with `pick`,
i.e. to `httpstat`. Other Ice-mod exists, `mv`, which works like `cp` but
**moves** a file (it is ran before `cp`).

### atpull"..."

Copying file is safe for doing later updates – original files of repository are
unmodified and `Git` will report no conflicts. However, `mv` also can be used,
if a proper `atpull` (an Ice–modifier ran at **update** of plugin) will be used:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin ice as"program" mv"httpstat.sh -> httpstat" pick"httpstat" atpull'!git reset --hard'
% zplugin light b4b4r07/httpstat
```

If `atpull` starts with exclamation mark, then it will be run before `git pull`,
and before `mv`. Nevertheless, `atpull`, `mv`, `cp` are ran **only if new
commits are to be fetched**. So in summary, when user runs `zplugin update
b4b4r07/httpstat` to update this plugin, and there are new commits, what happens
first is that `git reset --hard` is ran – and it restores original
`httpstat.sh`, **then** `git pull` is ran and it downloads new commits (doing
fast-forward), **then** `mv` is ran again so that the command is `httpstat` not
`httpstat.sh`.

For exclamation mark to not be expanded by Zsh in interactive session, use
`'...'` not `"..."` to enclose contents of `atpull` Ice-mod.

### Snippets-commands

Commands can also be added to `$PATH` using **snippets**. For example:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin ice mv"httpstat.sh -> httpstat" pick"httpstat" as"program"
% zplugin snippet https://github.com/b4b4r07/httpstat/blob/master/httpstat.sh
```

Snippets also support `atpull` Ice-mod, so it's possible to do e.g. `atpull'!svn
revert'`. There's also `atinit` Ice-mod, executed before loading plugin or
snippet (but after setting up its main directory).

### Completion Management

Zplugin allows to disable and enable each completion in every plugin. Try
installing a popular plugin that provides completions:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin ice blockf
% zplugin light zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

First command will block the traditional method of adding completions. Zplugin
uses own method (based on symlinks instead of adding to `$fpath`). Zplugin will
automatically *install* completions of newly downloaded plugin. To uninstall,
and install again, use

```SystemVerilog
% zplg cuninstall zsh-users/zsh-completions   # uninstall
% zplg creinstall zsh-users/zsh-completions   # install
```

#### Listing completions

(Note: `zplg` is an alias that can be used in interactive sessions). To see what
completions *all* plugins provide, in tabular formatting and with name of each
plugin, use:

```SystemVerilog
% zplg clist
```

This command is specially adapted for plugins like `zsh-users/zsh-completions`,
which provide many completions – listing will have `3` completions per line, so
that not many terminal pages will be occupied, like this:

```SystemVerilog
...
atach, bitcoin-cli, bower    zsh-users/zsh-completions
bundle, caffeinate, cap      zsh-users/zsh-completions
cask, cf, chattr             zsh-users/zsh-completions
...
```

You can show more completions per line by providing an *argument* to `clist`,
e.g. `zplg clist 6`, will show:

```SystemVerilog
...
bundle, caffeinate, cap, cask, cf, chattr      zsh-users/zsh-completions
cheat, choc, cmake, coffee, column, composer   zsh-users/zsh-completions
console, dad, debuild, dget, dhcpcd, diana     zsh-users/zsh-completions
...
```

#### Enabling and disabling completions

Completions can be disabled, so that e.g. original Zsh completion will be used.
The commands are very basic, they only need completion *name*:

```
% zplg cdisable cmake
Disabled cmake completion belonging to zsh-users/zsh-completions
% zplg cenable cmake
Enabled cmake completion belonging to zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

That's all on completions. There's one more command, `zplugin csearch`, that
will *search* all plugin directories for available completions, and show if they
are installed. This sums up to complete control over completions.

### Subversion For Subdirectories

In general, to use *subdirectories* of Github projects as snippets add
`/trunk/{path-to-dir}` to URL, for example:

```SystemVerilog
% zplugin ice svn; zplugin snippet https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/trunk/src
```

Snippets too have completions installed by default, like plugins.

### Turbo Mode (Zsh >= 5.3)

The Ice-mod `wait` allows you to postpone loading of a plugin to the moment when
processing of `.zshrc` is finished and prompt is being shown. It is like Windows
– during startup, it shows desktop even though it still loads data in
background. This has drawbacks, but is for sure better than blank screen for 10
minutes. And here, in Zplugin, there are no drawbacks of this approach – no
lags, freezes, etc. – the command line is fully usable while the plugins are
being loaded, for number of such plugins like `10` or `20`. For higher number of
plugins automatic queueing for next free time slot (i.e. delaying) is performed.

Zsh 5.3 or greater is required. To use this Turbo Mode add `wait` ice to the
target plugin in one of following ways:

```SystemVerilog
PS1="READY > "
zplugin ice wait'!0' atload'promptinit; prompt scala3'
zplugin load psprint/zprompts
```

This sets plugin `psprint/zprompts` to be loaded `0` second after `zshrc`. It
will fire up after 100 ms of showing of the basic prompt `READY >`. I'm running
this method of setting up a prompt from half year now, without any problems.

The exclamation mark causes Zplugin to reset-prompt after loading plugin. The
same with Prezto prompts, with longer delay:

```SystemVerilog
zplg ice svn silent wait'!1' atload'prompt smiley'
zplg snippet PZT::modules/prompt
```

Using `zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions` without any drawbacks:

```SystemVerilog
zplugin ice wait'1' atload'_zsh_autosuggest_start'
zplugin light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Autosuggestions uses `precmd` hook that is called right after processing `zshrc`
(before prompt). Turbo Mode will wait `1` second so `precmd` will not be called
at first prompt. This makes autosuggestions inactive at first prompt.
**However** the given `atload` Ice-mod fixes this, it calls the same function
`precmd` would, right after loading autosuggestions.

```SystemVerilog
zplugin ice wait'[[ -n ${ZLAST_COMMANDS[(r)cras*]} ]]'
zplugin load zdharma/zplugin-crasis
```

The plugin `zplugin-crasis` provides command `crasis`. Ice-mod `wait` is set to
wait on condition. When user enters `cras` at command line, the plugin is
instantly loaded and command `crasis` becomes available. **
link:https://asciinema.org/a/149725[See this feature in action] **. This feature
requires `zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting` (it builds the `ZLAST_COMMANDS`
array).

#### Automatic Load/Unload On Condition

Ices `load` and `unload` allow to define when you want plugins active or
unactive. For example:

```SystemVerilog
# Load when in ~/tmp

zplugin ice load'![[ $PWD = */tmp ]]' unload'![[ $PWD != */tmp ]]' atload"promptinit; prompt sprint3"
zplugin load psprint/zprompts

# Load when NOT in ~/tmp

zplugin ice load'![[ $PWD != */tmp ]]' unload'![[ $PWD = */tmp ]]'
zplugin load russjohnson/angry-fly-zsh
```

Two prompts, each active in different directories. This can be used to have
plugin-sets, e.g. by defining parameter `$PLUGINS` with possible values like
`cpp`,`web`,`admin` and by setting `load`/`unload` conditions to activate
different plugins on `cpp`, on `web`, etc.

Difference with `wait` is that `load`/`unload` are constantly active, not only
till first activation.

Note that unloading a plugin needs it to be loaded with tracking (so `zplugin
load ...`, not `zplugin light ...`). Tracking causes slight slowdown, however
this doesn't matter in turbo mode, as Zsh startup isn't slowed down.
